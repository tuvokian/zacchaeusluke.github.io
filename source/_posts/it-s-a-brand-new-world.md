This morning I woke with an urge to start a blog again. I used to have one, back when I was a naive teenager, with opinions on things I knew very little about, fully convinced that I knew what I believed and where I was going in life. When that all fell apart, I neglected the blog, and eventually deleted it.

Since then, a lot has changed and I now feel that I have something worth putting out there again. I have a fairly unique perspective on the world as a transgender, bisexual Catholic, and I have some small hope that my musings may help someone who is trying to live and reconcile the reality of seemingly conflicting elements of faith, transition, and sexuality.

My plan it to share my own story, and talk about my life as it happens, with some commentary on current events as I see fit.
