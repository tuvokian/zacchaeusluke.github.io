I set up Zacchaeus Crafts in April last year to try to fundraise for a hysterectomy. At this time I've raised nearly Â£2000 and I am so grateful to everyone who's contributed by donating, sharing and supporting me.

Back in November 2017 I had an appointment for my second opinion for surgery. Following this I was eventually referred to the local hospital for a hysterectomy. A couple of weeks ago I had a consultation with the gynaecologist and I am now expecting to have the surgery in September. 

As I have now been offered surgery on the NHS I am planning to donate the money I have raised to [Action for Trans Health](https://actionfortranshealth.org.uk/)'s solidarity fund to go towards other trans people's healthcare costs.

I have decided that I am going to continue Zacchaeus Crafts as I have enjoyed making and selling things. I'm pleased people like my designs and want to buy them. I will be continuing to fundraise for Action for Trans Health until the end of September as I am booked into a couple of Pride festivals this summer and I feel that I will be able to raise a substantial amount for AfTH through these.

After the **30th September** the profit will be split between Action for Trans Health or other trans people's gofundme's and my own living costs as required.

In addition to this, I am working on a new website for my craft business where I will be selling my goods in addition to etsy.
