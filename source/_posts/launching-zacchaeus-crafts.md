Today I'm excited to officially launch my craft shop: [Zacchaeus Crafts](https://www.etsy.com/shop/zacchaeuscrafts)! 

All the items are handmade or painted by me and I will be adding new products over the coming days and weeks. I primarily make trans and rainbow themed goods, but I am considering expanding slightly in the future. 

I've put a lot of my time into making these items and I've enjoyed every minute. It has been helpful to my mental health recovery, plus seeing finished products at the end is very satisfying. 

If you're in Sheffield and you'd like to buy something and collect it in person, please get in touch and I will be able to make arrangements with you.

### Why am I doing this?

I want to raise money in order to get a hysterectomy, which I am still ages away from on the NHS due to their ridiculous gatekeeping. I'm on testosterone, but I still get periods and they're extremely painful. They make me feel incredibly dysphoric and depressed, often even suicidal. I've been to GPs and gynaecologists and had multiple scans, all with no results. No-one seems to be able to find the cause and doctors have tried to gaslight me in telling me that the pain could be from my pelvic injuries instead. I've had this pain for over 10 years now, and I know what it feels like. I've tried various pills and contraception as well as injections and painkillers. None of these work. 

It feels as though every time I lift myself up and start feeling slightly better, I'm knocked back down again a week or so later. 

Last October I was told I was going to get a hysterectomy, only to have my hopes dashed when I was refused again just a few weeks later. This sent me into a mental health crisis and this was a large factor in my taking time out from university. I've been told I need to wait for a referral from the gender identity clinic for a hysterectomy but it will take over a year until they will get around to approving me for a hysterectomy and I just can't wait that long.

My only option now is to go private, but for this I need around Â£5000. Through selling my crafted items and donations I am hoping to be able to raise this money.
