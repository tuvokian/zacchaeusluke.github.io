<blockquote>you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up (Psalm 71:20)</blockquote>
During my daily Bible reading this was part of the Psalm that really stood out to me. I've been experiencing a lot of ups and downs in my mood lately and today has been a bit of a low day so this made me feel like God was reaching down to me and promising that things will get better again.
