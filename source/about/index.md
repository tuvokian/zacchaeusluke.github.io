# About 

Hey, I'm Zacchaeus, Zac for short.

I'm a maths graduate working in technology. I studied at the University of Sheffield, graduating with a 2:1 MMath degree.

## Blog
My blog, [Transistence](/blog), focuses on my personal experiences. Being transgender, bisexual and also Catholic may seem incongruous to some, but my life so far has been a process of learning how to reconcile these facts without leaving any part of myself behind. Iâ€™m also disabled with both physical and mental health-related disabilities and this blog provides an outlet for expressing thoughts on all of these aspects of myself.
